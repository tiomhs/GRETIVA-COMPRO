    question: "Do you provide support after launch?",

  },
  {
    question: "Will I be able to update the website myself?",

    question: "What technologies do you use?",

  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with startups or big corporations?",
    answer: "Both! We love the energy of early-stage startups and the scale of established enterprises. As long as you are ambitious and value good design, we are a match."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your payment terms?",
    answer: "Standard terms are a 50% deposit to kickstart the project, and the remaining 50% upon completion and approval. For larger projects, we can split it into milestones (e.g., 30/30/40)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is SEO included in the website package?",
    answer: "We build all websites with 'Technical SEO' best practices (fast loading, mobile-friendly, proper structure). However, ongoing SEO content strategy and backlinking are separate services."
